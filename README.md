This repo is a fork of [https://github.com/atomicptr/Cyberduck-Favorites](https://github.com/atomicptr/Cyberduck-Favorites).
The original has been archived and development has stopped.
It needed a path changed in a configuration file to allow it to work with newer Cyberduck releases.
My intention is not to continue development of this. I just wanted it to work for me.
